# CRAVEL-Overhauled
 This the official app Cravel of Cultural Coders 6.

Cravel is a travel discovery app focused on highlighting India's **lesser-known and underrated destinations**. Originally developed for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)**, Cravel has grown into a passion project dedicated to empowering travelers to explore beyond the usual tourist trails.

## 🌟 Features

- 🗺️ **Discover Hidden Gems**: Explore culturally rich but often overlooked locations across India.
- 🚨 **Report Issues**: Users can report site issues such as vandalism or maintenance problems to encourage preservation.
- 📊 **Upcoming**: A **density tracker page** to visualize the popularity and visit trends of each location (Coming soon – looking for database support!).

## 📖 The Journey

Cravel started as a team project of six for SIH, but eventually evolved into a **solo-developed** app. Despite the challenges, especially after some team members stepped back, the development experience was both intense and incredibly rewarding.

Whether or not Cravel makes it to the top 12 of SIH, this journey has been an unforgettable one—and the app now holds a special place in my portfolio.
